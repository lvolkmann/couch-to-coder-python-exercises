Let's learn Python!

## What's This All About?

This repository shall serve as a community tool for anyone that is looking to learn and practice Python skills.

## How Does It Work?

Following the table of contents below, the user should work through each exercise in a given topic before moving to the next. There are two types of file the user may encounter: .md (Markdown) and .py (Python). The markdown files are more conceptual in nature. The python files are for the actual implementation of the these concepts!

Each exercise has two associated files: *filename* and *filename*_FIXME. **Always start with the FIXME file!** This file contains the problem, and the non-FIXME file under the same name contains the solution.
