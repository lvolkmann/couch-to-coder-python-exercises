Describe the similarities and differences between a shell and a program when working with python.

Shell
- Executes line as they are entered
- Always returns a value
- Lines are not stored to be ran again in the future
- Good for testing
- Uses chevrons

Program
- A script of lines to execute in a specified order
- Terminates
- May be saved and accessed later
- This is like an application or an equation that you can keep coming back too
- Can be adaptable to different user inputs

Both
- Both run in the same version of python
- Single execution in each should produce the same result
