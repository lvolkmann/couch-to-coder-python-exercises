"""
Write a program to do the following:
	Build a deck of cards in the following form => suit value
		Hint: use for loops
	This deck should exist as a series of strings in a list ["H7", "CQ",...]
	If time:
		Draw a random card from the deck
		Devise a loop to draw two random cards and see if they're a match
		Keep track of number of tries
	If you want to go crazy:
		Create a loop that finds the average number of tries over n trials
