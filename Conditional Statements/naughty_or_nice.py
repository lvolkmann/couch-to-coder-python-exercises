Write a program to do the following:
	Create to empty lists: naughty and nice
    Get the name of the child from the user:
	Get the naughty/nice status of the child
	Sort the childâ€™s name into either the naughty or nice list
	Output the two lists
	Implement a reasonable degree of error handling

STRETCH GOAL:
	Have the program above run on a loop that can break
	Ask the user at then end of each loop if they would like to continue
