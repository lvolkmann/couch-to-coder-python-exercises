# While Loops V For Loops

Describe the similarites and differences between while and for loops

## While Loop Only
While a condition is met, do this
Check condition: can vary
Good for unknown data sets
Good for exhaustive iteration

## For Loop Only
For each x in a container, do this
Has 1 check condition: the size of the data structure passed
Good for known data sets
Still technically exhaustive (dependent upon scope)

## Both
Iterate until a check condition is met
May be prematurely ended with a break statement (continues work too)
