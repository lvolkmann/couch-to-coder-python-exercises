Let's learn Python!

## What's This All About?

This repository shall serve as a community tool for anyone that is looking to learn and practice Python skills. At the University of Missouri-Kansas City, I was a supplemental instructor for an entry-level programming course. This position required me to create various exercises and lesson plans to be executed alongside the main course. Rather than let these exercises succumb to data decay on some forgotten hard drive, I decided to make them publicly available for all.

## How Does It Work?

Following the table of contents below, the user should work through each exercise in a given topic (some jumping around may be necessary). There are two types of file the user may encounter: .md (Markdown) and .py (Python). The markdown files are more conceptual in nature. The python files are for the actual implementation of the these concepts!

Each exercise has two associated files: *filename* and *filename*_FIXME. **Always start with the FIXME file!** This file contains the problem, and the non-FIXME file under the same name contains the solution.

## How to Contribute?

I'm very much hoping this repository ages like a fine wine. If you have any suggestions to make it better or exercises of your own you'd like to publish, make a pull request!
