# Answer the following:

1.	Compare and contrast the uses of a for loop and a while loop.
- A for loop is used to iterate over items in a definite set of data, where whiles are used for indefinite sets of data.


2.	What is the difference between an expression and an assignment
- Expression evaluates to a thing where an assignment assigns a value to a variable


3.	Name three data types/structures that a for loop can iterate over
- String, list, dictionary, set, tuple, range (which is kind of just a list), etc.


4.	Name four string methods and what they do
- “This is a {}”.format(x) – formats and replaced 2.5’s %d string formatting; 
- .find(x) – finds the index of the first occurrence of the value passed to it;
- .count(x) – counts the number of occurrences of the value passed to it; 
- .replace(x,y) – replaces all occurrences;


5.	If x is a list of consecutive numbers starting at 0, Build a loop that imitates: 		for i in x:	using the following: len(), range(), for, x
- For i in range(0, len(x)):


6.	Describe the following components of a function: invocation, definition, docstring, return
- Invocation – is calling and implementing the function; 
- definition -  the suite of code implemented at call; docstring – description; 
- return – what function call evaluates to


7.	What’s the difference between an argument and a parameter?
- An argument is what you pass (the ball) and the parameter is what the argument is passed into (the mit)


8.	Name two modules, how to import them, and what they’d be used for.
- import math for math functions and constants; 
- import random for things like randint and randrange; 
- import time for sleep and time functions;


9.	Explain the difference between a break and a continue statement
- A break statement will exit the loop that it’s in where a continue will merely stop the current iteration and start the loop from the top
