- Variables are declared and defined during an assignment of some value
- Can take on user input

Data Types
- Int
    - Discrete
    - Good for countable situations
    - Good for equivalence relations
- Float
    - Continuous
    - Good for measurements
    - Bad for comparisons
- String

    - Good for unchanging strings of characters

Structures
- Set
    - Mutable
    - Unordered
